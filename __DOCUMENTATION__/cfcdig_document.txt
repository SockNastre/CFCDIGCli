CFC.DIG Structure:
	1. Header

16 blank bytes, whether or not this can be considered a header is debatable, but
these can be considered magic bytes or an identifier although that probably isn't their
intended meaning.

	2. File Records

For every file being packed there is an FileRecord struct here. In every CFC.DIG the
"offset" field is divided by 0x800. This is because all files and the header + file
records are padded to 0x800 as well.

	3. Data

File data, all data here is stored in the same order as the file records but this doesn't
technically have to be true given the FileRecord struct. Data is sometimes compressed, usually,
a file isn't compressed if the first 4 bytes are null.

Compression:

For info about compression check out here: https://github.com/Raw-man/Racjin-de-compression
It contains original C++ (de)compression code. The code for (de)compression provided by this
tool is from the above repo just converted to C#.

NOTE: The compression function is currently broken in my code. So I recommend for learning
the compression to follow along with the C++ code.
