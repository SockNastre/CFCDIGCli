This document is about how the filelist.txt system works with CFCDIGCli. By default
by tool doesn't need a filelist.txt but in cases where someone wants to organize
unpacked CFC.DIG files by names or in directories filelist.txt can be used.

As we we know from cfcdig_document.txt the CFC.DIG structure does not contain any file
names and it is important for file order to be kept when unpacking and repacking (the
game expects certain files in certain orders in CFC.DIG).

Let's say when you unpack CFC.DIG you get three files:

	1. 1_16_0.raw
	2. 2_1_1.raw
	3. 3_32_0.raw

Everything before the first underscore is the number that that file appears as in
the CFC.DIG, so, 1_16_0.raw is the first file in the CFC.DIG, 2_1_1.raw is the second,
etc.

Let's say we figure out the names of these files or we make our own:

	1. 1_16_0.raw -> MainMenuTexture.raw
	2. 2_1_1.raw -> Audio.raw
	3. 3_32_0.raw -> Loc.raw

Since my tool relies on Windows alphabetical order, how do we get these files packed
right in my tool? Simple, make a text file called "filelist.txt" and inside of it
put the new names you found/created in order of their original names. See
"filelist_ex.txt" for an example.

Now, when using my tool and packing add the "-l" option followed by your filelist text
file location: "CFCDIGCli.exe -p -i "input_folder" -o "CFC.DIG" -l "filelist.txt"

Now when my tool packs the CFC.DIG it will read the filelist and pack in that order
while checking "input_folder" for those files.

NOTE: Make sure you actually rename the .raw to match the new names you gave them.
