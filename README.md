### Credits
  - Biggest thanks to [Raw-man](https://github.com/Raw-man) (!Mr.JellyBean) for figuring out the compression/decompression algorithms, and for creating [Racjin (de)compression](https://github.com/Raw-man/Racjin-de-compression) which was the basis for my conversion of his C++ compression/decompression code into C#. He also helped confirm things about CFC.DIG and did some digging around into other game's CFC.DIG or similar archives that were made by Racjin.
  - Greg Beech for his [Natural String Comparer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/248613/10216412) which he posted onto Stack Overflow.
